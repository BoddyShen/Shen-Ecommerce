# Shen-Ecommerce

I recently built an e-commerce service using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and Node.js). This marketplace-style service allows registered users to browse and purchase products from other sellers, as well as upload and sell their own products. When an order is placed, it is displayed on both the buyer's and seller's pages.

The application is a single page application (SPA) built with ReactJS and uses Hooks (such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer) to manage state and perform various tasks. I used React-Bootstrap to style the user interface and make it responsive for different devices.

For the back-end, I used Express to build a RESTful API that allows the front-end to communicate with the MongoDB database. I implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for three types of data: users, products, and orders. Users can create an account, log in, and browse and purchase products. They can also view and update their personal information and view their order history.

Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project that allowed me to apply my knowledge of the MERN stack and learn new skills along the way. We welcome users to create an account and start using the service.
